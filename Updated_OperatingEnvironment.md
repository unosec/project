Operational Environment
-
A common operational environment for the community version of Nextcloud is in a small to medium-sized business where there is no full-time, IT staff, and the software was set up by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party. Often in this case, the software is hosted locally (installed on a server within the building) or via a Virtual Private Server. One or two employees are trained to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) for administration of the software. In this environment there is an expectation the software will not leak sensitive information through the local network or onto the internet. Administrators expect to manage user access and be notified of common security issues. Users expect personal information, confidential files, and data, stored within the software, to not be unnecessarily available for Nextcloud use. The business anticipates that vulnerabilities be disclosed, for the software to receive timely security updates, and for the GUI to be protected against basic web attacks.

Our scenario represents a privately-owned bank located in a small, Nebraskan town (<500 residents). Most of the bank's clientale are local farmers and ranchers, making loans very popular. The bank staff includes a President/Owner, Vice-President/Bank Manager, Loan Manager, 1 full-time Senior Teller, and 3 part-time tellers. The information stored in the Nextcloud application must be compliant with US federal banking regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GLBA, etc.).
