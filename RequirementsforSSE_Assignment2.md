Scenario
-
Our scenario represents a privately-owned bank located in a small, Nebraskan town (<500 residents). Most of the bank's clientale are local farmers and ranchers, making loans very popular. The bank staff includes a President/Owner, Vice-President/Bank Manager, Loan Manager, 1 full-time Senior Teller, and 3 part-time tellers. The information stored in the Nextcloud application must be compliant with US federal banking regulations (e.g., PCI DSS, GLBA, etc.).


Assignment Overview
-
This document will review five essential interactions between our hypothetical bank staff and the Nextcloud application.


Essential Interaction #1

### User Story

- As a Senior Bank Teller, I want to schedule a meeting with the part-time tellers so that we can review a recent policy change to our money handling policy.
