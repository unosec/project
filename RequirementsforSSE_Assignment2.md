*Assess the alignment of security requirements derived from misuse case analysis with advertised features of the open-source software:*

Nextcloud advertises a number of security features that can help prevent file management misuse cases. Such as their built-in role-based file access control, complete audit log of all actions taken, and several supported anti-virus integrations to keep end users safe. Many other security features are available including file encryption, comprehensive user management controls, along with end-to-end secure communication protocols for enhanced protection.
