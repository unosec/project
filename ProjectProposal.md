 Motivation 
-
We had initially planned to investigate a different project [audiobookshelf](https://github.com/advplyr/audiobookshelf) however the instructor suggested that instead we look for something that might be more likely to be used in the enterprise.  Josh had experience using NextCloud and suggested that as an option, so we decided to go with that.  Since this is a large system with a server component, desktop component, and mobile components there should be many areas available for further security analysis.
